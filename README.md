# Customer Churn Prediction

# Objective
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models, classifying customers as "Churn" or "Stay" based on attributes like age, income, and purchase frequency to help businesses improve retention.

# Tools and Libraries Used
- Python: For implementing machine learning models and data processing.
- NumPy: For generating synthetic customer data.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For training models and evaluating performance:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier

# Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression: A binary classifier for churn prediction.
- Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based model that splits data to predict churn.
- Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy.

# Steps Followed
1. Data Generation: Created synthetic data with customer features.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned data and checked for missing values.
3. Model Training: Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
4. Evaluation: Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. Visualization: Visualized Decision Tree and feature importances.

# Performance Metrics
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
- Confusion Matrix: Shows true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for churn and non-churn.
- Feature Importance: Identifies the most influential features.
